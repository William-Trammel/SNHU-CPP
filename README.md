# SNHU-CPP
Course Assignment for SNHU CPP

************************************************************
---Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.---
************************************************************

For Project 3, I was requested to create a program that will read a file and produce a visual graph along with verbal confirmation of how many of X items was purchased.
In this project, I used C++ and Python. I believe it show case that I can accorparate different languages together to make a program that could be used in the real world.

************************************************************
---What did you do particularly well?---
************************************************************

I believe that I demistrated how to make something look so simple for the end user to understand and use but use advance techinques to compile the program. I also followed best practice and standards to make sure my code is secure.

************************************************************
---Where could you enhance your code? How would these
improvements make your code more efficient, secure,
and so on?---
************************************************************

If I could enhance one thing, that would be modifing my program to accept barcode input, such as scanning, instead of a txt file input. This will make it more realistic and almost like a POS machine.

************************************************************
---Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging
to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or 
resources are you adding to your support network?---
************************************************************

The most challenging part is trying to understand how C++ comunicated with Python. Wrapping my head around this was very stressful because I like to know the mechanics behind the program. Online resources was really helpful and listening to multiple people explain how the code works seem to be the best solution for me.

************************************************************
---What skills from this project will be particularly
transferable to other projects or course work?---
************************************************************

Since this project required C++ and Python, future projects might call for these two languages to be used together again. I believe I can achieve this task after many hours and tears that I put into Project 3.

************************************************************
---How did you make this program maintainable, readable,
and adaptable?---
************************************************************

Following the programming standards sets a guideline for this. Personally, I like clean, organized, and well maintain code. Using comments, realatible varible names, and even re-using functions help me achieve this.
